*Sales Insights Data Analysis Project*

 **Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze sales data to uncover valuable insights. SQL is used for querying the data, while Power BI helps visualize trends. The analysis focuses on customer transactions, market performance, and revenue growth across different regions and currencies.

 **Objectives:**

1. **Retrieve and analyze customer and transaction records**
2. **Identify distinct products sold in specific markets**
3. **Calculate total revenue for different time periods and locations**
4. **Apply currency normalization for consistent revenue reporting**

 **SQL Queries**

1. **Retrieve All Customer Records**  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM customers;
   ```

2. **Count Total Number of Customers**  
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
   ```

3. **Display Transactions for Chennai Market**  
   *Market code for Chennai: `Mark001`*  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';
   ```

4. **List Unique Product Codes Sold in Chennai**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';
   ```

5. **Show Transactions Made in USD Currency**  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'USD';
   ```

6. **Retrieve All Transactions from 2020**  
   *Joins `transactions` and `date` tables to filter 2020 records.*  
   ```sql
   SELECT transactions.*, date.* 
   FROM transactions 
   JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
   WHERE date.year = 2020;
   ```

7. **Calculate Total Revenue for 2020**  
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) 
   FROM transactions 
   JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
   WHERE date.year = 2020 
   AND (transactions.currency = 'INR' OR transactions.currency = 'USD');
   ```

8. **Calculate Total Revenue for January 2020**  
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) 
   FROM transactions 
   JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
   WHERE date.year = 2020 
   AND date.month_name = 'January' 
   AND (transactions.currency = 'INR' OR transactions.currency = 'USD');
   ```

9. **Show Total Revenue Generated in Chennai During 2020**  
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) 
   FROM transactions 
   JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
   WHERE date.year = 2020 
   AND transactions.market_code = 'Mark001';
   ```

 **Power BI Data Analysis**

1. **Creating a Normalized `norm_amount` Column**  
   *This formula converts USD transactions to INR (1 USD = 75 INR) and keeps INR transactions unchanged.*
   
   ```powerbi
   = Table.AddColumn("Filtered Rows", "norm_amount", 
   each if [currency] = "USD" 
   then [sales_amount] * 75 
   else [sales_amount], type any)
   ```
