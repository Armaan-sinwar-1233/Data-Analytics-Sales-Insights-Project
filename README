Sales Insights Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover valuable insights using SQL Query---- for querying and Power BI for visualizing trends. The goal is to assess customer transactions, market performance, and revenue growth across different regions and currencies.

Objectives:
Retrieve and analyze customer and transaction records.
Identify distinct products sold in specific markets.
Calculate total revenue for different time periods and locations.
Apply currency normalization for consistent revenue reporting.

1. Retrieve All Customer Records:
SQL Query---- 
SELECT * FROM customers;

2.Count the Total Number of Customers:
SQL Query----
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

3.Display Transactions for Chennai Market:
The market code for Chennai is Mark001.
SQL Query----
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';

4. List Unique Product Codes Sold in Chennai:
SQL Query---
SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';

5. Show Transactions Made in USD Currency:
SQL Query----
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'USD';

6. Retrieve All Transactions From 2020:
This query joins the transactions and date tables to filter records from the year 2020.
SQL Query----
SELECT transactions.*, date.* 
FROM transactions 
JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
WHERE date.year = 2020;

7. Calculate Total Revenue for 2020:
Here, total revenue is calculated for both INR and USD transactions.
SQL Query----
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) 
FROM transactions 
JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
WHERE date.year = 2020 
AND (transactions.currency = 'INR' OR transactions.currency = 'USD');

8. Calculate Total Revenue for January 2020:
This query calculates revenue for the month of January in 2020.
SQL Query----
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) 
FROM transactions 
JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
WHERE date.year = 2020 
AND date.month_name = 'January' 
AND (transactions.currency = 'INR' OR transactions.currency = 'USD');

9. Show Total Revenue Generated in Chennai During 2020:
This focuses on revenue generated specifically in the Chennai market.
SQL Query----
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) 
FROM transactions 
JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
WHERE date.year = 2020 
AND transactions.market_code = 'Mark001';


-----------Power BI Data Analysis-------------
Creating a norm_amount Column:
This formula normalizes sales amounts by converting USD transactions to INR, assuming an exchange rate of 1 USD = 75 INR.
powerbi
Query -----
= Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_amount", 
   each if [currency] = "USD" 
   then [sales_amount] * 75 
   else [sales_amount], type any)
